## 💬 Notes for Reviewers

<!-- Optional: anything you want reviewers to pay special attention to. -->

For production Go changes in `internal/cli` or `internal/reviewtransaction`:

- [ ] Identify any qualifying security, integrity, admission, repair, or governance guard and challenge its legitimate input population against real-world evidence.
- [ ] Confirm its `guard:population` direction and claim are adjacent and accurate, and name the behavior tests that exercise the claimed population.
- [ ] Do not treat a passing declaration check as proof that no qualifying guard was omitted or that the population claim is semantically complete.
