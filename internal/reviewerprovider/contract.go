// targetedValidatorPromptInstruction is the targeted validator's complete
// briefing. Unlike a reviewing lens, this role may hold live tools on some
// runtimes, so the briefing must say which immutable-inspection command exists
// and where each of its arguments comes from. Withholding that recipe while
// inviting an "I could not inspect it" answer is what produced #3380: one
// runtime spent the lineage's single correction attempt on a non-observation
// and another stranded its lineage with no verdict at all.
//
// It also tells the validator to report an unreachable candidate through the
// typed check.inspection field, never through evidence wording (issue #4266):
// before this field existed, admission keyword-scanned each check's evidence
// for phrases like "could not be inspected", so a validator that faithfully
// quoted the candidate's own strings, or that described a feature about
// unreadable candidates, was misjudged as unable to read the candidate on
// every retry.
//
// The evidence paragraph distinguishes authored from generated paths because
// reviewProviderMaterializeEvidence hands this role the same representation a
// lens receives: a generated path arrives as an immutable metadata summary
// with its content hunks omitted. A briefing that still promised the complete
// patch for every path would have this role read a verified verdict out of a
// summary it was told was not one -- a signed verdict on bytes it never saw.
// A lens can be told that what it cannot see is not evidence; this role cannot,
// because a correction that touches a lockfile or a golden is exactly what it
// must judge. So the briefing routes that case to inspect-candidate, and to a
// typed unavailable check when no command is available.
