## Engram Persistent Memory

Engram persistent memory is ACTIVE. The full protocol (save format, lifecycle,
search flow, after-compaction steps) is delivered every session by the Engram
MCP server instructions and the SessionStart hook. Always-on rules:

- Before the first `mem_context`, `mem_search`, or `mem_review`, call
  `mem_current_project` and wait for it (pass the runtime workspace as `cwd`
  only if the tool schema accepts it). Apply the first matching rule and stop:
  (1) runtime workspace unknown, returned `cwd` missing or different, or the
  call fails: skip those initial reads and say Engram must run from the
  correct workspace; (2) `available_projects` non-empty or `project_source`
  `ambiguous`: ask the user to choose exactly one value, never pass it as
  `project`, and re-resolve only via `cwd` with that repository's directory,
  else skip those reads; (3) empty `project`: skip those reads; (4) otherwise
  pass the exact returned `project` as `project`. Never invent a name or fall
  back to all projects unless the user explicitly asks to recall across
  projects or from a named other project.
- Call `mem_save` PROACTIVELY after any decision, bugfix, discovery, convention,
  or config change — do not wait to be asked. Use `capture_prompt: false` for
  automated artifacts.
- On any reference to past work: `mem_context` → `mem_search` → `mem_get_observation`.
- Before saying "done", call `mem_session_summary`.
- Saving to memory is bookkeeping, never the reply: it NEVER counts as answering.
  End every turn with the complete user-facing answer as the final message (no
  tool calls after it), and save memory before composing it — never collapse the
  answer into a "saved / done" acknowledgement.
- If a memory call fails or times out, deliver the answer anyway — memory
  failures never block or replace the reply.
- If `mem_session_start` fails with `ambiguous_project`: resolve the intended
  repository root and retry `mem_session_start` with that root as `directory`.
  The session ID remains unregistered until registration succeeds; never attach
  an unregistered session ID to writes. Do not pass `project`,
  `project_choice_reason`, or `recovery_token` to `mem_session_start`.
- On `ambiguous_project` from write tools (`mem_save`, `mem_save_prompt`,
  `mem_session_summary`): never guess. Ask the user to choose exactly one value
  from `available_projects`, then retry the write tool with `project`,
  `project_choice_reason=user_selected_after_ambiguous_project`, and the
  returned `recovery_token`.
