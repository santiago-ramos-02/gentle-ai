## Components

| Component | ID | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Engram™ | `engram` | Persistent cross-session memory via MCP — auto-detection of project name, full-text search, git sync, project consolidation. See [engram repo](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram) |
| Skills | `skills` | Curated coding skill library |
| Context7 | `context7` | MCP server for live framework/library documentation |
| Persona | `persona` | Managed Gentleman/neutral persona injection, or unmanaged custom persona mode |
| Permissions | `permissions` | Security-first defaults and guardrails. Applied to Claude Code and OpenCode/Kilocode (the adapters with permissions overlay support). Default sensitive-paths deny list: `~/.ssh/*`, `~/.ssh/**/*`, `**/*.pem`, `**/*.key`, `**/.env*`, `~/.credentials/*`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`, `~/Library/Keychains/*`, `**/secrets/*`, `**/*.p12`, `**/*.pfx`. OpenCode/Kilocode follow the Gentle Pi safety model: everything is allowed by design; recursive `rm` on `/`, `~`, `$HOME`, `.` or `..` (also behind `sudo`), hard reset, forced `git clean`, force push (also with `git -C <dir>`), `chmod -R 777` and recursive `chown` are denied; other recursive `rm`, `find -delete`, destructive SQL passed to `psql`/`mysql`/`mariadb`/`sqlite3`, `git push`, `git rebase`, `git branch -D` and `npm publish` ask; remote commands ask (#4324); and the sensitive paths are denied to `read` and `edit` (which covers write and patch). Like Pi, reading a secret through `bash` or the `grep` tool is not blocked. Wildcard rules cannot parse shell syntax the way Pi does, so other wrappers (`env`, `xargs`, `VAR=value`), nested shells, absolute executable paths, unusual flag permutations, and `rm -rf /*` are not guarded. |
| GGA | `gga` | Gentleman Guardian Angel — AI provider switcher |
| Theme | `theme` | Gentleman Kanagawa theme overlay |

ODD (Organic Driven Development) is shared routing guidance, not a separate component to install. It is the only implementation workflow for direct and delegated work. See [ODD and recovery](usage.md#organic-driven-development-odd).

> **Since v4.0.0:** the SDD (Spec-Driven Development) component and its `sdd-*` skills are retired in favor of ODD. A legacy `sdd` selection persisted in state is still read, but install and sync no longer write its assets. A global install or sync also removes the native `sdd-*` sub-agents earlier releases rendered for Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, and Kimi, proven by comparing each file with every released template; edited files are preserved and reported as manual actions. A Kimi `gentleman.yaml` inherited from v3.x declares every SDD subagent by path: when its bytes match a release, sync rewrites it first so the cleanup completes; when it was edited, sync keeps every SDD agent it references and reports one manual action naming it. For OpenCode and Kilocode, install and sync remove the `sdd-*` agent entries (including profile copies and the 3.7.0 plural `agents` map) and the `prompts/sdd/` files releases wrote; see [OpenCode compatibility](opencode-compatibility.md). For every runtime except Pi, install and sync also remove the retired `sdd-*` skills, the shared `_shared/sdd-*.md` and `_shared/openspec-convention.md` references (including the shared `~/.agents/skills` root outside Windows), the `/sdd-*` and `/gentle-sdd-*` slash commands, and the Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook that runs the removed `gentle-ai sdd-preflight-hook` command, each only when it matches what a release wrote. A workspace-scoped sync handles the workspace copies, including the Windsurf `.windsurf/workflows/sdd-new.md` workflow. An edited SDD skill keeps its whole directory and the shared SDD references it reads. A skills, skill, or `_shared` directory that is a symlink is never entered, and Claude Code settings that are a symlink or not strict JSON are never rewritten; both are reported with the exact file or hook to remove. Claude Code's `_shared/sdd-orchestrator-workflow.md` was rendered per installation: it is removed when it matches what a release's own writer renders with no model assignments or with one of that release's model presets, and kept and reported otherwise, for example when it carries model assignments you customized. For Codex, install and sync remove the `sdd-strong`, `sdd-mid`, and `sdd-cheap` `.config.toml` profiles when they hold exactly what a release wrote (only the `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` values may differ); a profile with anything else, including a profile left by downgrading to v1.36–v1.38, is kept and reported. They also remove the `<!-- gentle-ai:sdd-orchestrator -->` block from the lowercase `~/.codex/agents.md` that v1.7.10 to v1.31.0 wrote, when it is a separate file from `AGENTS.md`; a file that held only the block is left empty. For Kimi, they remove `~/.kimi/sdd-orchestrator.md` when it matches a release's render and the exact `{% include "sdd-orchestrator.md" ignore missing %}` line from `~/.kimi/KIMI.md`. A workspace-scoped sync retires the same Codex and Kimi files a workspace-scoped install wrote under the project and, since it refreshes no routing guidance for Claude Code or Codex, removes the v3.7.0 SDD orchestrator block from their project prompt files. Only one block whose markers each fill a line is removed; a file with an unmatched, repeated, or nested marker is kept unchanged and reported. Prompt files that are symlinks, or that sit in a symlinked `~/.codex` or `~/.kimi`, are never rewritten and are reported. Removed files are captured in the sync backup.

## Explicit install modifiers

Explicit `--persona` and `--skill` / `--skills` options require their consumer
component in the resolved install plan: `persona` and `skills`, respectively.
An orphaned modifier is rejected before self-update or any install files or state
are written, including with `--dry-run`. The validated plan is reused for execution.
The diagnostic names `gentle-ai install` as the continuation. Rerun it with the
required `--component` added to your existing component list, or remove the
modifier. Keep your other agents and flags unchanged; components are not added
automatically.

```bash
gentle-ai install --agent claude-code --component theme,persona --persona neutral --dry-run
gentle-ai install --agent claude-code --component skills --skill go-testing --dry-run
```

Implicit defaults do not require additional components. `--persona custom` remains
an opt-out from managed persona and does not require `persona`. `--sdd-mode` remains
retired and is not accepted by install.

**Compatibility change:** commands that previously succeeded while silently
ignoring an explicit modifier now fail with a diagnostic and a nonzero exit code.

## Context7 sync behavior

Install and sync add the agent-specific Context7 default when its server entry is absent. Existing entries are migrated only if the complete parsed entry exactly matches a known default written by a released gentle-ai version, such as the legacy unpinned or pinned `2.2.5` npx launcher. Key order and whitespace do not matter; extra or changed fields do. Custom commands, arguments, environment, URLs, headers, and different version pins (including `4.2.0` or `@latest`) are preserved untouched. Remove a customized entry explicitly to install the current default again.

Claude Code cleans up an inert legacy `settings.json` entry only when it exactly matches a released managed default; customized entries are left alone.

## Primary remote-authorization guidance

Always-installed agent guidance includes a canonical remote-operation boundary, independent of the optional persona and permissions components. Local-development access does not authorize remote execution, transfer, or discovery/reuse of ambient SSH agents, ControlMaster sockets, credentials, or sessions. Ask for explicit destination, operation, and credential/session authorization; authorized work remains allowed within stricter user/runtime restrictions.

This first delivery covers the 15 non-Pi primary instruction carriers, not every executor role or named profile. Pi remains owned by `gentle-pi`. The behavioral section provides no sandbox or fresh-human-per-execution guarantee. Separately, OpenCode/Kilocode permission defaults ask for direct ssh/scp/sftp/rsync commands, without silently replacing personal allows or restrictions; existing installs must opt into permission sync. See [sync update instructions and limitations](usage.md#sync). Issue #4324 remains open for the remaining projections and native approvals.

## GGA Behavior

`gentle-ai install --component gga` installs/provisions the `gga` binary globally on your machine.

It does **not** run project-level hook setup automatically (`gga init` / `gga install`) because that should be an explicit decision per repository.

After global install, enable GGA per project with:

```bash
gga init
gga install
```

## Optional Community Tools

Community Tools are opt-in and are not included by presets or automatic detection. Select them from the installer’s **Community Tools** screen.

| Tool | Behavior | Removal |
|---|---|---|
| CodeGraph | Installs its CLI and configures supported agent MCP/guidance integration. | Use CodeGraph’s upstream lifecycle commands. |

### CodeGraph initialization workspace

For project initialization, the explicit agent working directory is the target—not an enclosing Git repository. Check its local `.git` (directory or worktree file) and `.codegraph/` first. Ancestor Git-root discovery is only appropriate for an already-selected existing repository.

`gentle-ai codegraph init --cwd <project-root>` requires that target to be a Git root and rejects unsafe locations. For a new nested project without local Git, initialize Git there first (`git -C <project-root> init`) as part of the requested project setup, then retry CodeGraph initialization at the same target. Do not substitute the parent repository or initialize Git merely to answer a codebase question.

## Skills

### Included Skills (installed by gentle-ai)

Skill files organized by category, embedded in the binary and injected into your agent's configuration:

#### Review

| Skill | ID | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Judgment Day | `judgment-day` | Parallel adversarial review — two independent judges review the same target |

#### Foundation

| Skill | ID | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Go Testing | `go-testing` | Go testing patterns including Bubbletea TUI testing |
| Skill Creator | `skill-creator` | Create new AI agent skills following the Agent Skills spec |
| Skill Improver | `skill-improver` | Audit and improve existing skills against the repository style guide |
| Branch & PR | `branch-pr` | PR creation workflow with conventional commits, branch naming, and issue-first enforcement |
| Issue Creation | `issue-creation` | Issue filing workflow with bug report and feature request templates |
| Skill Registry | `skill-registry` | Build an index of installed skills with triggers, scopes, and exact `SKILL.md` paths |
| Chained PR | `chained-pr` | Plan and create reviewable stacked/chained pull requests |
| Cognitive Doc Design | `cognitive-doc-design` | Write docs that reduce review and onboarding cognitive load |
| Comment Writer | `comment-writer` | Draft warm, direct collaboration comments and review replies |
| Work Unit Commits | `work-unit-commits` | Split implementation into reviewable work units |
| RDD Defect Workflow | `rdd-defect-workflow` | Guide receipt-driven defect work with truthful evidence and authority boundaries |

Of these, `go-testing`, `skill-creator`, `skill-improver`, `skill-registry`, `chained-pr`, `cognitive-doc-design` and `work-unit-commits` are installed by default with both the `full-gentleman` (Dev Stack + Polish) and `ecosystem-only` (Dev Stack) presets. `branch-pr`, `issue-creation`, `comment-writer` and `rdd-defect-workflow` are repository-contributor workflow skills: they remain selectable with an explicit `--skills <id>`, but no default preset installs them.

### Coding Skills (separate repository)

For framework-specific skills (React 19, Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind 4, Zod 4, Playwright, etc.), see [Gentleman-Programming/Gentleman-Skills](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/Gentleman-Skills). These are maintained by the community and installed separately by cloning the repo and copying skills to your agent's skills directory.
