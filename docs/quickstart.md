# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

### macOS

- Homebrew installed and available in PATH.
- `git` available.
- If Homebrew requires trust, run `brew trust --formula gentleman-programming/tap/gentle-ai` once for Gentle AI™ only.
  - To install several tools from this tap, use `brew trust gentleman-programming/tap` instead. It trusts all current and future formulas, casks, and external commands published in the tap.

### Ubuntu/Debian (and derivatives like Linux Mint, Pop!\_OS)

- `apt-get` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.
- If Node.js is missing, `gentle-ai install` prints this install hint: NodeSource LTS setup + `apt-get install -y nodejs` (npm comes bundled).
- If using Homebrew on Linux, Bubblewrap may require unprivileged user namespaces; see `docs/usage.md#homebrew-upgrade-troubleshooting`.

### Arch Linux (and derivatives like Manjaro, EndeavourOS)

- `pacman` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.
- If Node.js is missing, `gentle-ai install` prints this install hint: `pacman -S --noconfirm nodejs npm`.

### Fedora / RHEL family (Fedora, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux)

- `dnf` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.
- If Node.js is missing, `gentle-ai install` prints this install hint: NodeSource LTS setup + `dnf install -y nodejs` (npm comes bundled).

### All platforms

- Git.
- Go 1.25.10+ (for building from source).
- Node.js 18+ and npm: `gentle-ai install` checks these as required prerequisites on every platform and prints a warning with an install hint if either is missing (the Node.js hints for the distros above are listed there; npm's hint asks you to install Node.js first) — regardless of which agents/components you select. It does not install them for you, and it does not install agent runtimes either: most selected agents are configured even when their runtime isn't detected, so install those yourself. Pi and OpenCode are the exceptions: `gentle-ai install` stops until `pi` is on `PATH` (for Pi) or `opencode --version` succeeds (for OpenCode). Node.js/npm are strictly required if you select the CodeGraph community tool, which gentle-ai does install via `npm install -g`.
- Pi installed and available as `pi` on `PATH` if you select the Pi agent.

### Windows

- Go 1.25.10+, because Windows installs and upgrades through `go install`.
  Official Windows binaries and the Scoop bucket are temporarily unavailable
  while publicly trusted Authenticode signing is provisioned, so nothing
  unsigned is ever fetched. With Go on `PATH`, `gentle-ai upgrade` updates
  itself automatically by running `go install …/cmd/gentle-ai@vX.Y.Z` pinned to
  the release tag and verified against the Go checksum database; without Go it
  fails closed and just prints that command. See [platforms.md](platforms.md)
  and the
  [restoration gate](release-signing.md#windows-distribution-restoration-gate).

```powershell
# Stable channel: the latest release (v4.0.0)
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v4/cmd/gentle-ai@v4.0.0
```

Go requires a major-version suffix (`/v4`) in the module path for major
version 2 and above. Installing the old `/v3` module path stays on the v3 line
and never reaches v4.

## Version Policy

The latest published stable release is [`v4.0.0`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/releases/tag/v4.0.0). `@latest` on the `/v4` module path tracks the stable channel. Use `@main` only to test unreleased development changes.

### Install the stable channel

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v4/cmd/gentle-ai@latest
gentle-ai version
```

### Install unreleased development changes

Only use `main` when testing changes that are not part of a release yet:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v4/cmd/gentle-ai@main
gentle-ai version

# Windows (PowerShell)
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v4/cmd/gentle-ai@main
gentle-ai version
```

`go install` ignores `GENTLE_AI_CHANNEL`; `gentle-ai` reads it on later runs, where `beta` tracks `main` instead of the latest release. Tools that Homebrew manages keep updating through Homebrew. To update a beta installation later, preserve the beta channel:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
GENTLE_AI_CHANNEL=beta gentle-ai upgrade

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GENTLE_AI_CHANNEL="beta"; gentle-ai upgrade
```

`gentle-ai upgrade` advances the `gentle-ai` binary from `main` and refreshes managed tools on macOS, Linux, and Windows with Go on `PATH`.

If you re-run an installer, pass beta explicitly because both installers default to stable:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --channel beta

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GENTLE_AI_CHANNEL="beta"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

> **Go module proxy cache**: `proxy.golang.org` can lag behind new commits on `main` for up to several hours. If manual `go install ...@main` does not update to the newest commit, bypass the cache with `GOPROXY=direct go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v4/cmd/gentle-ai@main` (PowerShell: `$env:GOPROXY="direct"; go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v4/cmd/gentle-ai@main`).

The managed install scripts select the latest version for their chosen channel and do not accept arbitrary release pins. Use `go install` with an exact tag when you need a reproducible prerelease or stable version.

## Run

```bash
gentle-ai install --dry-run
```

Use `--dry-run` first to validate selections and execution plan without applying changes. The dry-run output includes a `Platform decision` line showing the detected OS, distro, package manager, and support status.

From a source clone, run `go run ./cmd/gentle-ai install` (with or without `--dry-run`) instead.

## First real install

```bash
gentle-ai install
```

The installer detects your platform automatically — no flags needed to select macOS vs Linux. On Linux, it uses the first supported package manager it finds on `PATH`; see [Supported Platforms](platforms.md) for the full list and detection order.

For a beta install that selects Engram, Go must be on `PATH`. If it is missing, dependency preflight stops before the backup snapshot or component apply and prints a platform-specific installation hint.

Stable Engram installs and beta plans without Engram do not gain a Go requirement.

After completion, verify that agent configs and selected components were installed to their expected paths.

The agents you select during install become the default scope for future `gentle-ai sync` runs. Gentle AI records that selection in `~/.gentle-ai/state.json` and does not automatically sync every agent config directory that exists on your machine. To check what will be updated after an upgrade, run:

```bash
gentle-ai sync --dry-run
```

To update a different set explicitly, pass every target agent:

```bash
gentle-ai sync --agent claude-code --agent opencode
```

## Verification outcome

When checks pass, the installer prints a ready message that names the agent commands you installed, for example:

``You're ready. Run `claude` or `opencode` and start building.``

If something looks wrong after install, run `gentle-ai doctor` for a read-only health check. It verifies tool binaries, `state.json` validity, Engram™ MCP reachability, and disk space — each check reports pass/warn/fail with a remedy hint.

For a Pi-only install, the plan shows the Pi package stack instead of Gentle AI components. It installs `gentle-pi`, `gentle-engram`, `pi-web-access`, and `pi-btw` through Pi's package manager, without a separate `pi-engram init` registration. Engram exposes native Pi tools; Pi's built-in MCP support (Pi >= 0.99.0) runs other servers, such as CodeGraph, from `mcp.json`. Install and sync also repair unambiguous Engram package duplicates while preserving the retained version and object options; conflicting declarations require manual resolution. Gentle AI removes a previously installed `pi-mcp-adapter`, because an extension that registers `/mcp` replaces Pi's built-in MCP support.

## Start working with ODD

Open your agent in the project and describe an outcome, for example: "Add CSV export using the existing report filters." [Organic Driven Development (ODD)](usage.md#organic-driven-development-odd) is the development workflow: explore, implement authorized work, and check it. Substantial work keeps one recoverable feature document; small/read-only work avoids durable artifacts.

## Hardening recommendations for users

Gentle AI pins versions and disables postinstall scripts on every npm install it generates. When you install the `permissions` component, a sensitive-paths deny list is applied to Claude Code and OpenCode blocking access to `~/.ssh/*`, `**/*.pem`, `**/*.key`, `**/.env*`, `~/.aws/credentials`, and other credential paths. See [Components](../docs/components.md) for the full list.

For broader protection across npm packages you install yourself, set these once on your machine:

- `npm config set ignore-scripts true` — blocks postinstall scripts globally; the primary supply-chain attack vector.
- `npm config set min-release-age 3` — skip packages published in the last 3 days; catches malicious typosquats before you install them.
- `npm config set allow-git none` — block git: dependencies, which can be moving targets.

Optional wrapper tools for extra defense:

- [`npq`](https://github.com/lirantal/npq) — audits a package against several heuristics before it installs.
- [`sfw`](https://socket.dev/) (Socket Firewall) — runtime guard that intercepts suspicious behavior at install/run time.

## Unsupported platforms

If you run the installer on an unsupported OS or Linux distro, it exits immediately with an error:

- `unsupported operating system: only macOS, Linux, and Windows are supported (detected <os>)`
- `unsupported linux distro: no package manager found on PATH (detected distro <distro>).` The full error lists the package managers it searched, in order, and a command to check which ones your machine has.
